# Solid Timer

A Rubik's cube timer application inspired by ChaoTimer and csTimer built using SolidJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Capacitor.

# Data Storage

All data is stored in the browser using different API's, settings are stored in `localStorage` and all session related information such as solves are stored in `indexedDB`.

There are plans in the future to create a cloud storage option with cross-device sync that will be available to paying users.
